&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>></strong>JB<strong><</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; is a Tech Lead at ThoughtWorks. He has spent over 14 years in the sports data world working with big, fast, critical microservice ecosystems. A keen microservice advocate he is looking forward to helping companies release the potential of their digital platforms by embracing the small and chatty.

Throughout his career in software, aided by heroic colleagues he has navigated the minefield of failure and occasionally stumbled on a tale of success. Weeding out the sources of failure and cultivating those that breed success, he hopes to tell his tales; sell his wares, and make the world a better place.
