The first panicked 3am call from a founding member of the company telling you that something is down and you have 10 minutes to fix it! ...is a great day!. It means your software means something. It has value. But after the dust settles and we all realise that we donâ€™t know when the next critical failure is, how do we start gaining visibility on the health and fitness of our systems? are dashboards the answer?

This lightning talk focuses on how we can keep value in our overhead dashboards in our office space as well as my own teams journey on gaining visibility in a critical new system we built.

There was an interesting question from the audience after this talk which wasn't captured in the video (partly down to me trying to evade questions :stuck_out_tongue:). The question was:

*"Can you talk about some of the tools you used for aiding your team"*

This question actually caught me by surprise, and whilst the they were absolutely correct that I maybe should have spoken about some of the tools we used such as **nagios, CheckMK, OPSGenie, graylog, graphite**. It struck me that the successful visibility we had on this project was absolutely down to the tools we used but much more about the culture of visibility we adopted and the mindset we had. Embracing outages was more important than buying tools. However, I'm not sure we would have been able to do it without the tools listed above.

Just like tools dashboards don't bring visibility alone, they are just another tool to empower the culture.
