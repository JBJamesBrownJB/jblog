- Production is the only place your software matters and...
- ...there is no place like production
- There is no test entry point like each users end compute node and...
- ...only your users know what 'functional' means

In order to be confident that your software is achieving its goal you must ask every single user to test every peice of functionality in production, constantly. Anything short of this is an inferior compromise.
